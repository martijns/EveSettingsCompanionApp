The Microsoft Windows Store submission requires a privacy policy. The application fetches your profile picture
from the CCP API ("https://images.evetech.net/characters/\{Id\}/portrait"), so technically your IP address is exposed
when fetching the profile picture from CCP.

However, this application does not collect any sort of information.
